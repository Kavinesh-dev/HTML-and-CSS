  Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them
  asked 5 dog owners about their dog's age, and stored
  the data into an array (one array for each). For now, they
  are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or 
  puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and 
  it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.

  Create a function 'checkDogs' which accepts 2 arrays of
  dogs' ages ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the
  following things;

  1. Julia found out that the owners of the FIRST and LAST TWO
  dogs actually have cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of
  Julia's array, and remove the cat ages from the copied array
  (because it's a bad practice to mutate function parameters)

  2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's
  data

  3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an 
  adult ("Dog numeber 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy 
  ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy")

  4. Run the function for bothe test datasets


  TEST DATA 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's 
  data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]

  TEST DATA 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's 
  data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
*/

const checkDogs = function (dogsJulia, dogsKate) {
  const juliaCorrected = dogsJulia.slice();
  juliaCorrected.splice(0, 1);
  juliaCorrected.splice(-2, 2);

  const dogs1 = [...juliaCorrected, ...dogsKate];

  dogs1.forEach(function (dog, i) {
    if (dog >= 3)
      console.log(`Dog number ${i + 1} is adult, and is ${dog} years old`);
    else console.log(`Dog number ${i + 1} is still a puppy üê∂`);
  });
};

checkDogs([3, 5, 2, 12, 7], [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]);

/*

  Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs.
  This time, they want to convert dog ages to human ages
  and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study

  Create a function "calcAverageHumanAge", which 
  accepts an array of dogs ages ('ages'), and does 
  the following things in order:

  1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the folliwng
  formula: if the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAGe = 2 * dogAge. 
  If the dog is > 2 years old, human = 16 + dogAge * 4.

  2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years 
  old ( which is the same as keeping dogs that are at least
  18 years old)

  3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you
  should already know from other challenges how we calculage averages)

  4. Run the function for both test datasets

  TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
  TEST DATA 2  [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

  GOOD LUCK üéâ

// const calcAverageHumanAge = function (ages) {
//   const humanAge = ages.map(age => (age <= 2 ? 2 * age : 16 + age * 4));
//   console.log(humanAge);

//   const adults = humanAge.filter(adult => adult >= 18);
//   console.log(adults);

  Rewrite the 'calcAverageHumanAge' function from the previous challenge, 
  but this time as an arrow function, and using chaining!
